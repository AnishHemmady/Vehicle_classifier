# Vehicle_classifier
Classifying Sedan vs Non Sedan using Neural networks.This application will be updated in future with more training data and 
classifying more classes specifically as trucks,motorcycles etc.
I had classified earlier vehicles into 3 classes like sedan,truck,motorcycles with small dataset.
This has more data but due to less number of data available in motorcycle class and less number of data available in truck class,i have classifieditas sedan and non-sedan
The input images data has been captured by propietary software made by me and my teammate during Hackathon event.This program took snapshots of vehicles from video we had taken in Indianapolis.
If you require that program which grabs vehicles please mail me at->ahemmady@iupui.edu or ahemmady@purdue.edu.
